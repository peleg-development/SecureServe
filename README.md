SecureServe is a comprehensive and advanced anti-cheat solution for FiveM, designed to keep your server secure and ensure a fair gameplay environment. This project is completely free and open-source.

## Read Before Use!!!
1. Upon initial installation, you may see a ban reason:
   > "A player has been banned for Trigger Event with an executor (name of the event)"
2. To fix this issue, go to the configuration file.
3. Copy the name of the event causing the ban.
4. Add this event name to the **whitelisted events list** in the config.
5. This will resolve the issue caused by encrypted and decrypted scripts running the same events due to the encryption method used to prevent event triggering.

## Key Features
